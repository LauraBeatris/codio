Putting the **NODE_ENV** environment variable as development you can do API calls with your token. So you'll be able to access more endpoints like user notifications. For that, go to your GitHub Profile Setting and create a token, after this, copy it and put in a environment variable called **REACT_APP_GIT_TOKEN** 

These headers will be included to your requests 
```
    Content-Type: 'application/json',
    Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3.raw',
